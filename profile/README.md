## Beckstein Lab at Arizona State University ðŸ‘‹


The [*Beckstein Lab*](https://becksteinlab.physics.asu.edu/) is part of the [Center for Biological Physics](https://cbp.asu.edu/) and the [Department of Physics](https://physics.asu.edu) at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu). It is headed by [Oliver Beckstein](https://becksteinlab.physics.asu.edu/people/11/oliver-beckstein).

The lab uses computational approaches such as [molecular dynamics simulations](https://becksteinlab.physics.asu.edu/research/27/molecular-dynamics-simulations) in order to understand the function of biomolecules, in particular membrane proteins, at the molecular level.  

Our work belongs to the area of computational biophysics. We aim to *quantitatively predict the function and activity of proteins from the knowledge of their structures alone* and so to *better understand biological phenomena at the molecular level*, in particular transmembrane transport processess catalyzed by membrane proteins such as secondary active transporters and ion channels. This works contributes to the fields of structural biology, physiology, nanobiotechnology as well as ultimately to the development of new drugs.
